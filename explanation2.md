A binary search algorith is first used to find the pivot, and then to find the number based on the position of the pivot. binary search algorithms have a time complexity of O(log(n)). iteration is used instead of recursion to reduce space complexity. The space complexity of the two binary searches are O(1).

time: O(log(n))
space: O(1)
